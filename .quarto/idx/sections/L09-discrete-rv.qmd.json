We know that the sample space is the set of pairs of numbers between 1 and 6.\nBut if we are rolling the two dice as part of a board game, we might only care about the *total* score on the two dice, and the actual the two individual dice scores might be irrelevant. Let us wrote write $X$ for the total score. This $X$ is a sort of \"numerical summary\" of the experiment. Probabilists call such a numerical summary a **random variable**.\n\nOne we've defined this random variable $X$, it can be easier to work with $X$ than with sample spaces and events. For example, if we want to know the probability that our two dice rolls add up to 5, it's more convenient to write\n\\[ \\mathbb P(X = 5) \\]\nrather than\n\\[ \\mathbb P(A) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad A = \\big\\{ (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) \\big\\} . \\]\nThe probability that $X = 5$ is $\\mathbb P(X = 5) = \\frac{4}{36} = \\frac{1}{9}$. We might also be interested in other things about the total score $X$, like what the average total score over many pairs if dice rolls is.\n\nThe good news is that, once we have properly set up our random variable $X$, we can often then choose to ignore things like the sample space, the probability measure, and individual events.\n\nRandom variables are typically given capital letters from late in the alphabet, like $X$, $Y$, $Z$. Values that those random variables take are often given the lower-case equivalent, like $x$, $y$, $z$.\n\nThis idea of a random variable as a numerical summary of an experiment is how we *think* about random variables when solving problems. On the other hand, as mathematicians, we also want to define carefully what a random variable is as a mathematical object. We'll discuss that now (but if you find the next couple of paragraphs difficult to follow, you won't miss much if you skip them).\n\nIn this formal mathematical view, our experiment of rolling two dice is represented by a sample space\n  \\[  \\Omega = \\big\\{ \\boldsymbol\\omega = (\\omega_1, \\omega_2) : \\omega_1, \\omega_2 \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\} \\big\\}  \\]\nof pairs $\\boldsymbol\\omega = (\\omega_1, \\omega_2)$ of numbers from 1 to 6, where $\\omega_1$ represents the first dice roll and $\\omega_2$ the second dice roll.\nThe random variable $X$ is the score on the first dice plus the score on the second dice -- that is,\n\\[ X(\\boldsymbol\\omega) = \\omega_1 + \\omega_2 . \\]\nIn other words, $X$ is a *function* which takes in a sample outcome $\\boldsymbol\\omega \\in \\Omega$ and outputs a real number $X = X(\\boldsymbol\\omega) = \\omega_1 + \\omega_2$.\n\n<!--\nHere, $X$ is an example of what we call a **random variable**. A random variable can be thought of as a numerical summary of an experiment (like the total summarising the two individual dice rolls). But by considering the random variable directly, it often means we don't have to worry so much about exactly what the sample space is, or what probability measure is being used, or which sample outcomes are in a particular event. This often makes our life easier when thinking about probability problems.\n\n\n\nThe formal definition of a random variable is as a function that turns the outcome into this numerical summary.\n-->\n\n::: {.definition}\nLet $\\Omega$ be a sample space. Then a **random variable** is a function $X$ from $\\Omega$ to the real numbers $\\mathbb R$; that is, to each sample outcome $\\omega$ it assigns a real number $X(\\omega)$.\n\nExpressions like $\\mathbb P(X = x)$ or $\\mathbb P(X \\in A)$ should be understood as representing more formal probabilities\n\\[ \\mathbb P \\big( \\{\\omega : X(\\omega) = x \\}\\big) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\mathbb P \\big( \\{\\omega : X(\\omega) \\in A \\}\\big)  . \\]\n:::\n\n<!--\nThis formal definition of a random variable as a function was summarised by my own first-year probability lecturer as \"There's only two things you need to know about the definition of a random variable: first, it's not random; second, it's not a variable.\"\n\nHowever, the way we actually *think* about random variables *is* as random and is as variables. In this more informal way of thinking, a random variable is a variable that can take different values with different probabilities -- just as the total of the two dice can be 2 with probability $\\frac{1}{36}$, or the value 3 with probability $\\frac{2}{36}$, and so on.\n-->\n\nIt's useful to have a notation for the values a random variable can take.\n\n\\newcommand{\\Range}{\\operatorname{Range}}\n\n::: {.definition}\nThe set of values a random variable $X$ can take is called its **range**, $\\Range(X) = \\{X(\\omega) : \\omega \\in \\Omega \\}$.\n:::\n\nSo, for example, the range of the dice total $X$ is $\\Range(X) = \\{2, 3, \\dots, 12\\}$, because those are the possible outcome from the sum of two dice rolls.\n\nRandom variables that we will consider in this module will be one of two types:\n\n* **Discrete random variables** have a range that is a collection of discrete separate counts, so $\\Range(X)$ is finite (like the dice total being an integer between 2 and 12) or countably infinite (like the positive integers). Discrete random variables can be used as models for \"count data\".\n* **Continuous random variables** have a range that is a continuum of slowly varying measurements, so $\\Range(X)$ is uncountably infinite (like the real numbers, the positive real numbers, or the interval $[0,1]$). Continuous random variables can be used as models for \"measurement data\".\n\nFor this week and the two weeks after, we will look at discrete random variables; later in Lectures 15 to 17 we will look at continuous random variables.\n\n\n## Probability mass function  {#pmf}\n\n<!--\n:::: {.videowrap}\n::: {.videowrapper}\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYYTNk7F4KI\"></iframe>\n:::\n::::\n-->\n\nWe now consider only discrete random variables $X$, where the range $\\Range(X)$ is finite or countably infinite. To fully understand a discrete random variable $X$, we need only understand the probabilities $p(x) = \\mathbb P(X = x)$. These are captured by the probability mass function.\n\n::: {.definition}\nFor a discrete random variable $X$, its **probability mass function** (or **PMF**) is the function $p_X$ where \n\\[ p_X(x) = \\mathbb P(X = x)  \\qquad \\text{for $x \\in \\Range(X)$.} \\]\n(When the random variable $X$ is obvious from context, we'll just write $p(x)$ without the subscript.)\n:::\n\nOnce we have the PMF, then Axiom 3 tells us that for any set $A$, we have\n\\[ \\mathbb P(X \\in A) = \\sum_{x \\in A} \\mathbb P(X = x) = \\sum_{x \\in A} p(x) . \\]\n(Recall that the symbol $\\in$ means \"is an element of\", or just \"is in\" for short.) So the probability that $X$ is in some set $A$ can be found by simply adding up $p(x)$ for all the values $x$ in $A$. Thus the PMF $p(x)$ is the only thing we need to know.\n\n<!--\nThe key idea about random variables is that, once we are thinking in terms of a random variable via its PMF, we can (usually) stop worrying to much about what the underlying sample space is and how the random variable acts on that space.\n-->\n\n::: {.example}\nConsider tossing a biased coin, that is Heads with probability $p$ and Tails with probability $1-p$. Let $X = 1$ if the coin lands Heads, and $X = 0$ if the coin lands Tails. The PMF $p_X$ of this random variable is given by\n\\[ p_X(0) = 1 - p \\qquad p_X(1) = p . \\]\n\nWe could alternatively think of the same random variable $X$ as representing the result of an experiment, where $X = 1$ represents a success, with probability $p_X(1) = p$, and $X = 0$ represents a failure, with probability $p_X(0) = 1 - p$.\n\nA random variable $X$ with this PMF is called a **Bernoulli trial** (or a \"Bernoulli random variable\", or is said to \"follow the Bernoulli distribution\" -- after the seventeenth-century Swiss mathematician [Jacob Bernoulli](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bernoulli_Jacob/)). We use the notation $X \\sim \\text{Bern}(p)$ for short.\n:::\n\n::: {.example}\nLet $X$ being the sum of two dice rolls. As this is a classical probability problem, the probability $p(x)$ of rolling a total of $x$ is $n(x) / 36$, where $n(x)$ is the number of ways of rolling a total of $x$. So, for example, there is only one way $(1,1)$ of rolling a total of 2, so $p(2) = \\frac1{36}$, but there are 5 ways of rolling a 6: $(1,5), (2,4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1)$; so $p(5) = \\frac5{36}$.\n\nThe PMF $p$ of $X$ is given by\n\n| $x$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ | $5$ | $6$ | $7$ |\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n| $p(x)$ | $\\frac{1}{36}$ | $\\frac{2}{36}$ | $\\frac{3}{36}$ | $\\frac{4}{36}$ | $\\frac{5}{36}$ | $\\frac{6}{36}$ |\n\n| $x$ | $\\cdots$ | $8$ | $9$ | $10$ | $11$ | $12$ |\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n| $p(x)$ | $\\cdots$ | $\\frac{5}{36}$ | $\\frac{4}{36}$ | $\\frac{3}{36}$ | $\\frac{2}{36}$ | $\\frac{1}{36}$ |\n\n```{r dice-pmf, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}\nx <- 2:12\nprob <- c(1:6, 5:1)/36\n\nplot(x, prob, type = \"h\", xlab = \"dice total, x\", ylab = \"probability mass function, p(x)\", xlim = c(0, 15), ylim = c(0,0.2), col = \"blue\", lwd=3)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that since $p(x) = \\mathbb P(X = x)$ is a probability, it must be greater than or equal to 0, by Axiom 1. Further, if we add up $p(x)$ we get\n\\[ \\sum_{x} p(x) =  \\sum_{x \\in \\Range(X)} \\mathbb P(X = x) = \\mathbb P\\big(X \\in \\Range(X)\\big)  =  \\mathbb P(\\Omega) = 1,  \\]\nby Axiom 2.\nHence we have the following:\n\n::: {.theorem}\nLet $X$ be a discrete random variable, and let $p_X$ be its PMF. Then\n\n* $p_X(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in \\Range(X)$;\n* ${\\displaystyle \\sum_{x \\in \\Range(X)} p_X(x) = 1}$.\n:::\n\n## Cumulative distribution function {#cdf}\n\nSometimes it is useful to know the probability a random variable $X$ is less or equal to than some value $x$. This is captured by the **cumulative distribution function** (or **CDF**) $F_X$, where\n\\[ F_X(x) = \\mathbb P(X \\leq x) = \\sum_{y \\leq x} p_X(y) \\qquad \\text{for $x \\in \\mathbb R$.}  \\]\n\n::: {.example}\nLet $X \\sim \\text{Bern}(p)$ be a Bernoulli random variable with success probability $p$. It's impossible for the outcome to be less than 0; it is at least 0 but strictly less than 1 only if it equals 0, which happens with probability $p(0) = 1-p$; and it is certain to at most 1. So its CDF $F$ is\n\\[ F(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{for $x < 0$} \\\\\n                      1-p & \\text{for $0 \\leq x < 1$} \\\\\n                      1   & \\text{for $x \\geq 1$} . \\end{cases} \\]\n:::\n\n::: {.example}\nIf $X$ is the sum of two dice rolls, then the CDF $F$ is given by adding up the PMF. So, for example:\n\n* If $x < 2$, then $F(x) = 0$, because it's not possible to have $X \\leq x < 2$. \n* If $2 \\leq x < 3$, then $F(x) = p(2) = \\frac{1}{36}$, because $X = 2$ is the only outcome with $X \\leq x < 3$.\n* If $3 \\leq x < 4$, then $F(x) = p(2) + p(3) = \\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{2}{35} = \\frac{3}{36}$, as $X = 2$ or $3$ are the only outcomes with $X \\leq x$.\n* ...\n* If $x \\geq 12$, then $F(x) = 1$, because we always have $X \\leq 12 \\leq x$.\n\n| $x \\in {}$ | $(-\\infty, 2)$ | $[2,3)$ | $[3,4)$ | $[4,5)$ | $\\cdots$ | $[11,12)$ | $[12, \\infty)$ |\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n| $F(x)$ | $0$ | $\\frac{1}{36}$ | $\\frac{3}{36}$ | $\\frac{5}{36}$ | $\\cdots$ | $\\frac{35}{36}$ | $1$ |\n\n```{r dice-cdf, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}\nx <- 2:12\nprob <- c(1:6, 5:1)/36\ncdf <- cumsum(prob)\n\nplot(c(-1,x, 16), c(0, cdf, 1), type = \"n\", xlab = \"x\", ylab = \"cumulative distribution function, F(x)\", xlim = c(0, 15), ylim = c(0,1), col = \"blue\", lwd = 2)\nabline(h = 1, col = \"grey\", lty = 2)\npoints(c(-1,x, 16), c(0, cdf, 1), type = \"s\", col = \"blue\", lwd = 2)\n```\n\nNote that the CDF is a \"step function\" that starts at 0, then jumps up suddenly at each of the values $2, 3, \\dots, 12$, finally ending up at 1.\n:::\n\nFor any random variable $X$ with CDF $F$,\n\n* if $x$ is smaller than everything in the $\\Range(X)$, then $F(x) = 0$, because $X$ cannot be that small;\n* if $x$ is greater than everything in the $\\Range(X)$, then $F(x) = 1$, because $X$ cannot be any bigger than that;\n* $F(x)$ is increasing in $x$, because the probability you are less than $x$ gets bigger as $x$ gets bigger.\n\n\n## Summary  {#summary-L09 .unnumbered}\n\n::: {.mysummary}\n* A random variable is a numerical summary of a random experiment.\n* The probability mass function (PMF) is $p_X(x) = \\mathbb P(X = x)$.\n* The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is $F_X(x) = \\mathbb P(X  \\leq x)$.\n* A Bernoulli random variable is 0 with probability $1-p$ and 1 with probability $p$.\n:::"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"L09-discrete-rv.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.475","theme":"cosmo","toc-title":"MATH1710"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"L09-discrete-rv.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"documentclass":"report"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
